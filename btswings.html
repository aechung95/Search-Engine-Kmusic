    <p>Wings is a unique album with a fascinating storyline about growth, using the symbol of wings to represent growth and coming-of-age. The album is also notable in that it includes the solo tracks of all 7 members, yet still links each track to the overall concept. The complex and puzzling imagery used in the album’s promotions and music videos left many fans in a daze, resulting in some interesting theories regarding the music video for “Blood Sweat and Tears,” as well as each member’s solo promotions.</p>
